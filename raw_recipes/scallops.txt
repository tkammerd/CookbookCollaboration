Turkey Scallopes

poultry, casseroles, main dishes

      ---- Casserole ----
8 ounces Herb stuffing mix
3 cups Turkey (or Chicken); cubed
1/2 cup Butter
1/2 cup Flour
1/4 tsp Salt
1 dash Pepper
4 cups Turkey broth (or Chicken broth)
6  Eggs; slightly beaten
      ---- Pimiento Sauce ----
1 can Cream of mushroom soup
1 cup Sour cream (or plain yogurt)
1/4 cup Milk
1/4 cup Pimientos; chopped

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Prepare stuffing according to package directions.  Layer in bottom of a
9"x13" pan.  Top with chicken.  In a large saucepan, make gravy with flour,
butter, and broth.  Beat eggs, then stir a small amount of gravy into the
beaten eggs, then stir the resulting mixture into the remainder of the
gravy (the intention being to avoid cooking the eggs with the hot gravy
before they are well mixed through the gravy.)  Pour the egg/gravy mixture
over the chicken, and bake uncovered in a slow oven (325 degrees) for 40-45
minutes, or until crust is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in
middle comes out clean.  Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes
before serving.

During stand-time, combine mushroom soup, sour cream, milk, and pimentos.
Heat in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until sauce is hot,
smooth and consistently mixed, or in a microwave safe bowl in the microwave
oven on high, for 3-5 minutes, stirring every minute, until sauce is hot,
smooth, and consistently mixed.

Use a spatula or knife dipped in hot water to cut casserole into 8
servings, and serve topped with pimento sauce.

NOTES : One of the best things about Thanksgiving dinner at our house was
the next meal, which was almost always Turkey Scallops made with the
leftover turkey.  The Pimiento Sauce makes for a perfect complement in
tastes.
