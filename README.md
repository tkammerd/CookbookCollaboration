# CookbookCollaboration
Online recipe submission system to support publication of a printed cookbook.

As a board member of the East Texas Baptist University Alumni Association, I led 
a fundraising project to create an alumni cookbook, and single-handedly built an
online full stack recipe submission system to support the project.

The system was developed in HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, XML, and MySQL (over 
1800 lines of code) in the fall of 2005. It allowed credentialed accounts to be 
created for multiple volunteers in disparate locations and provided a web-based 
interface to enter recipes submitted by alumni in handwritten or text email into
a consistent database format for publication.
